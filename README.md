## Tutoring Katas

These are an assortment of useful katas for both teaching and learning and programming with Python. I have used this technique before with people I have tutored before and found it to be quite effective.

I have utilized a format that it is similar to the katas on Codewars. Shout out to [Codewars](http://codewars.com)!

It is encouraged that anyone using these attempts multiple different approaches including dictionaries, list comprehensions, generators, map(), filter(), zip(), enumerate(), etc.
